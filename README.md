# AcFace

## Introduction of this project

This project introduces a novel acoustic-based facial recognition system designed to deliver exceptional performance even under conditions where facial masks obscure parts of the face. The system is built around two primary components:

1. **Signal Processing Module**: This module processes raw acoustic signals to create precise 3D representations of faces. It is engineered to accurately capture facial features, ensuring the system's effectiveness even when traditional visual cues are partially hidden.

2. **Deep Learning Model**: This component is responsible for the recognition and differentiation of faces based on the 3D representations generated by the signal processing module. It has been meticulously trained to maintain high accuracy levels, specifically in scenarios involving facial masks.

The diagram below offers a visual overview of the system's architecture.

Within this repository, we offer a comprehensive suite of tools required to deploy this system, including the signal processing algorithms essential for extracting facial spectrums and the deep learning framework for spectrum analysis and recognition. Furthermore, we have included a specially curated dataset to facilitate the evaluation of the system's performance across a diverse range of scenarios.
