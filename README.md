# AcFace

## Introduction of this project

This project introduces a novel acoustic-based facial recognition system designed to deliver exceptional performance even under conditions where facial masks obscure parts of the face. The system is built around two primary components:

1. **Signal Processing Module**: This module processes raw acoustic signals to create precise 3D representations of faces. It is engineered to accurately capture facial features, ensuring the system's effectiveness even when traditional visual cues are partially hidden.

2. **Deep Learning Model**: This component is responsible for the recognition and differentiation of faces based on the 3D representations generated by the signal processing module. It has been meticulously trained to maintain high accuracy levels, specifically in scenarios involving facial masks.

The diagram below offers a visual overview of the system's architecture.

Within this repository, we offer a comprehensive suite of tools required to deploy this system, including the signal processing algorithms essential for extracting facial spectrums and the deep learning framework for spectrum analysis and recognition. Furthermore, we have included a specially curated dataset to facilitate the evaluation of the system's performance across a diverse range of scenarios.

## Code structure

This section outlines the key components of our codebase and their functionalities. Our project is structured to ensure easy navigation and comprehension of the acoustic-based facial recognition system's implementation.

### Key Components

- `RDNet_train_test.py`
  - **Description**: This file serves as the entry point for running the entire training and testing pipeline. It orchestrates the process from data loading to model evaluation, involving initialization of dataset loaders, model instantiation, training, and testing. This file ties all components together, facilitating an end-to-end execution of the RD-Net model.

- `model.py`
  - **Description**: This file defines the architecture of RD-Net. It includes the ResidualBlock and RDNet classes, which together construct the backbone of our facial recognition model.

- `train.py`
  - **Description**: This file encapsulates the training logic within the Trainer class, including model optimization and loss computation. It manages the training process over multiple epochs, leveraging backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize the loss function. Metrics such as accuracy and loss per batch/epoch are computed and displayed to monitor the training progress. 

- `test.py`
  - **Description**: This file hosts the Tester class, which oversees the model evaluation on test data. This class is responsible for loading the trained model, executing the forward pass without gradient calculation, and computing key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
